## About

This web application allows users who purchase the service to view multimedia content such as series and movies totally inspired by the Disney+ app but with my personal touch ðŸ‘Œ. It consists of the following main components:

- **Login**: Implements validation logic for empty fields and allowed characters for the email field, in addition to the implementation of login with Google.

- **Home**: Contains 5 cards representing categories to which the logged-in user will have access. Includes a basic navbar with a logout button.

- **Content Category**: Presents all content related to the selected category of the `Home` component in rows. Add the poster that represent the different contents.

- **Content Details**: Shows the selected multimedia content from the `Content Category` component along with its synopsis, year of release and category to which it belongs (the category is clickable) and poster of the content.

## Test Users

To facilitate testing, the application comes with predefined test users:

```bash
email = munozrengifocarlos@gmail.com
password = munozrengifocarlos@gmail.com
```

```bash
email = munozrengifocarlos@outlook.com
password = munozrengifocarlos@outlook.com
```

Feel free to use these credentials to log in and explore the application.

## Features

- Login with email and password using `Firebase` authentication. with form management with `React Hook Form` and field validations with `Zod`. Login with Google was added.

- Management of global state with `API Context` and simulation of data fetching to obtain the content within the application, it was used in this way since the state of the app was simple and the behavior of `API Context` was sufficient for the implementation of global state.

- A 500ms load is simulated to fetch the multimedia content, which is why skeleton was used to avoid sudden jumps when waiting for the request to be resolved.

- The application has public and private routes, using a custom component to perform this validation when a user is logged in.

- It has a grid design to display the content posters, all the styles of the app were made with `TailwindCSS` to achieve quick prototyping.

- Dynamic routes were used to use as a persistence state so the user must go to the home when they enter the application for the second time. In addition to allowing transparent navigation.
